# Code Metrics
> Plugin shows complexity information

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/codemetrics/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/codemetrics/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This plugin implements live calculation of the **Cognitive Complexity** metric,
which was proposed by G. Ann Campbell in
[Cognitive Complexity - A new way of measuring understandability](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf)
(c) SonarSource S.A. 2016-2021, Switzerland.

> **Abstract:** Cyclomatic Complexity was initially formulated as a measurement
> of the "testability and maintainability" of the control flow of a module.
> While it excels at measuring the former, its underlying mathematical model is
> unsatisfactory at producing a value that measures the latter. This white paper
> describes a new metric that breaks from the use of mathematical models to
> evaluate code in order to remedy Cyclomatic Complexity‚Äôs shortcomings and
> produce a measurement that more accurately reflects the relative difficulty of
> understanding, and therefore of maintaining methods, classes, and applications.

## Configuration

## üñ• Usage

These are functions you can use to analyze:

| Functions             | Description                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `codemetrics-analyze` | Analyze a string with `major-mode` |
| `codemetrics-region`  | Analyze region                     |
| `codemetrics-buffer`  | Analyze the whole buffer           |

All these functions returns a score indicates the complexity.

## üî® Supported languages
